we performed customer segmentation using K-Means clustering based on spending and income patterns after data preprocessing, feature engineering, and scaling. We identified distinct customer groups to inform targeted marketing strategies by analyzing clusters visually and quantitatively.

Clustering:

Cluster 1 (Red): This cluster appears to be at the lower end of both income and spending. These customers may be categorized as low-income, low-spending.

Cluster 2 (Green): Customers in this cluster have a higher income compared to Cluster 1 but still have low spending. They could be considered as high-income, low-spending customers who are potentially conservative spenders or are not attracted to the current product offerings.

Cluster 3 (Blue): This group shows customers with mid-range income and spending habits. They represent the middle-market customers.

Cluster 4 (Yellow): These customers are also in the mid-range income bracket but have higher spending, suggesting that they might be less price-sensitive or more engaged with the offerings.

Cluster 5 (Magenta): This cluster is characterized by low income but high spending, indicating these customers may prioritize spending on the products or services being analyzed over other expenses, or they might be influenced by promotions.

Centroids (Cyan): Each cluster has a centroid (indicated by cyan dots), which is the mean position of all the points in the cluster. It acts as the "center" of each cluster.

The x-axis is labeled 'Income' and the y-axis 'Total_Spending'. Both axes have positive and negative values, suggesting that the data has been scaled or normalized.
